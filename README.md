# Rotten Tomatoes Sentiment Analysis with DeepLearning

This is my current attempt to study deep learning in PyTorch.

In order to do this I have chosen the Rotten Tomato sentiment analysis problem. The dataset used here is avaiable at http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/stanfordSentimentTreebank.zip .

Most of the code in the notebooks was taken from https://github.com/falloutdurham/beginners-pytorch-deep-learning/. Here, it was simply tweaked to solve the the aforementioned problem. 

Please refer to the following book for more details:
